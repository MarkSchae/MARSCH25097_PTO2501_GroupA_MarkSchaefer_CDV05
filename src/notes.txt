Drop down nav bar for mobile
Do not forget to gitignore the node_modules

I want to add a window into my more fun/hobby side when clicked

Which projects to polish:
    Task manager/remember app
    The django typing game
    The e commerce site
    Maybe the social media one 
    Create a new project with django/python back and react/js front and do the Figma design for this project 
    Using viewport units is problematic 
    Naming conventions are not good enough

UNFORTUNATLEY MOST OF THIS WILL NEED TO BE REFACTORED. The beauty of learning.
